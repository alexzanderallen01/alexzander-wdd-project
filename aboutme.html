      <h4>Me:</h4>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Alexzander. I am currently taking all
        online classes as I finish up work and find housing down in Rexburg. I
        was born in Meridian Idaho and I current still live there. I also have a
        cat name Storm.
      </p>
      <h4>Degree:</h4>
      <p>
        I am currently trying to get a degree in computer science, although I am
        still thinking about switching to a engineering degree. I want to work
        in a robotic's field, but I equally like build a robot and trying to
        make the AI for it.
      </p>

      <h4>Hobbies:</h4>
      <p>
        My main hobbie currently would be gaming. I play a lot of Stardew
        Valley, Terraria, and Minecraft. Over a year ago my main
        hobbie was adding on to my website I made my sophomore year of high school. I stop
        working on it when I had to replace my computer and Oracle VM didn't
        want to work on it. I still try and make thing using Visual Studio Code,
        but I don't do it as offen anymore.
      </p>
      <h4>Why this class:</h4>
      <p>
        I am in this class for 2 main reasons. The first would be for the
        computer science degree and the second would be I miss making things in
        HTML. Back in high school I pretty decent at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        I really enjoyed making things for my website and planed on taking a
        class or two in college to expand my skills.
